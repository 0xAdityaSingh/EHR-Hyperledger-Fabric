## Project: A Blockchain based healthcare data-sharing platform

### Introduction
Data-sharing in healthcare is critical for a complete patient care experience. A patient goes to multiple hospitals/ clinicians in their healthcare journey but their medical data is not being recorded in a confidential and integral way by any authority. Doctors at some different clinics might need to refer to a patient's medical history to make good decisions for treatment. We aim to build a blockchain solution using hyperledger fabric that can offer a way to share the patientsâ€™ medical data with various healthcare-related organisations while maintaining data integrity, confidentiality and patient privacy.
